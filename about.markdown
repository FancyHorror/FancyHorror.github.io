Fancy Horror makes alt-psych music out of Chicago, IL.
The members performed first in 2012 during a live power hour in someone’s garage one college night
([The Spencer Davis Group – Gimme Some Lovin’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6Q-v-94Lo)).
They played just the one song together and that was it.
Fast forward six years to the Fall of 2018 and they have regrouped musically.
If the authors [Philip K Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) and
[Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King) had a band that wrote the soundtrack to a
[Black Mirror season](https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888),
the resulting band would be similar to that of Fancy Horror.
They will fill you with fuzz, buzz, weird thoughts, and new words just ‘cuz.
Sounds are best received when standing in a
[$3 tall-boy kind of bar](https://www.colesbarchicago.com/).
