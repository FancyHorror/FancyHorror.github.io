#### Short Bio:

Fancy Horror makes alt-psych music out of Chicago, IL.
If the authors Philip K Dick and Stephen King had a band that wrote the soundtrack to a Black Mirror season,
the resulting band would be similar to that of Fancy Horror.
They will fill you with fuzz, buzz, weird thoughts, and new words just ‘cuz.
Sounds are best received when standing in a $3 tall-boy kind of bar.
