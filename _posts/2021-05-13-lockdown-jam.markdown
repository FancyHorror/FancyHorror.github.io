This lockdown is ending soon in the US, kinda already is depending on where you are...

Before it ends, we wanted to make sure we got a virtual show in.
Check out our [twich](https://www.twitch.tv/fancyhorror) for updates; THIS Friday May 14 at 9pm CDT.

We're gonna play some new stuff, some old stuff, and a few things in between.

Stay safe and try to be happy,

FH
